            <h1>Chapter 1<br>The Beginning Of Things</h1>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">It was really most extraordinary. There was Philip Mannering, doing his best to
                puzzle out algebra problems, lying full-length under a tree with nobody near him at all and yet he could
                hear a voice speaking to him most distinctly. 'Can't you shut the door, idiot?' said the voice, in a
                most impatient tone. 'And how many times have I
                told you to wipe your feet?' Philip sat up straight and took a good look round for the third time but
                the hillside stretched above
                and below him, completely empty of any boy, girl, man or woman.
                'It's so silly,' said Philip to himself. 'Because there is no door to shut, and no mat to wipe my feet
                on. Whoever is speaking must be perfectly mad. Anyway, I don't like it. A voice without a body is too
                odd for any thing.' A small brown nose poked up out of Philip's jersey collar. It belonged to a little
                brown mouse, one of
                the boy's many pets. Philip put up a gentle hand and rubbed the tiny creature's head. Its nose twitched
                in delight. 'Shut the door, idiot!" roared the voice from nowhere, and don't sniff. Where's your
                handkerchief?
                This was too much for Philip. He roared back. 'Shut up! I'm not sniffing. Who are you, anyway?
                There was no answer. Philip felt very puzzled. It was uncanny and peculiar. Where did that extraordinary
                voice with its rude commands come from, on this bright, sunny but completely empty hillside? He shouted
                again.
                I'm working. If you want to talk, come out and show yourself.'
                All right, Uncle,' said the voice, speaking unexpect edly in a very different tone, apologetic and
                quiet.
                'Gosh!' said Philip. 'I can't stand this. I'll have to solve the mystery. If I can find out where the
                voice comes from, I may find its owner.' He shouted again. 'Where are you? Come out and let me see you."
                'If I've told you once I've told you a dozen times not to whistle,' answered the voice fiercely. Philip
                was silent with astonishment. He hadn't been whistling. Evidently the owner of the voice must be
                completely mad. Philip suddenly felt that he didn't want to meet this strange person. He would rather go
                home without seeing him. He looked carefully round. He had no idea at all where the voice came from, but
                he rather thought it must be somewhere to the left of him. All right, he would go quietly down the hill
                to the right, keeping to the trees if he could, so that they might hide him a little.
                He picked up his books, put his pencil into his pocket and stood up cautiously. He almost jumped out of
                his skin as the voice broke out into cackles of laugh rer. Philip forgot to be cautious and darted down
                the hillside to the shelter of a clump of trees. The laughter stopped suddenly.
                Philip stood under a big tree and listened. His heart beat fast. He wished he was back at the house with
                the others. Then, just above his head, the voice spoke again.
                'How many times have I told you to wipe your feet?' Then there came a most unearthly screech that made
                poor Philip drop his books in terror. He looked up into the tree near by, and saw a beautiful white
                parrot, with a yellow crest on its head that it worked up and down. It gazed at Philip with bright black
                eyes, its head on one side, its curved beak making a grating noise.
                Philip stared at the parrot and the parrot stared back. Then the bird lifted up a clawed foot and
                scratched its head Ivery thoughtfully, still raising and lowering its crest. Then it spoke.
                'Don't sniff,' it said, in a conversational tone, 'Can't you shut the door, idiot? Where are your
                manners?' "Golly!' said Philip, in amazement. 'So it was you talking and shouting and laughing! Well -
                you gave me an awful fright.' The parrot gave a most realistic sneeze. 'Where's your
                handkerchief?' it said. Philip laughed. 'You really are a most extraordinary bird,' he said. "The
                cleverest I ever saw. Where have
                you
                escaped from?'
                'Wipe your feet,' answered the parrot sternly. Philip laughed again. Then he heard the sound of a boy's
                voice, calling loudly from the bottom of the hill.
                'Kiki, Kiki, Kiki! Where have you got to?"
                The parrot spread out its wings, gave a hideous
                screech, and sailed away down the hillside towards a
                house set at the foot. Philip watched it go.
                "That was a boy calling it,' he thought. And he was in the garden of Hillfoot House, where I'm staying.
                I wonder if he's come there to be crammed too. I jolly well hope he has. It would be fine to have a
                parrot like that living with us. It's dull enough having to do lessons in the hols - a parrot would
                liven things up a bit."
                Philip had had scarlet fever the term before, and measles immediately afterwards, so that he had missed
                most of his school-work. His headmaster had written to his uncle and aunt suggesting that he should go
                and stay at the home of one of the teachers for a few weeks, to make up a little of what he had missed.
                And, much to Philip's disgust, his uncle had at once agreed - so there was Philip, in the summer
                holidays, having to work at algebra and geography and history, instead of having a fine time with his
                sister Dinah at his home, Craggy Tops, by the sea.
                He liked the master, Mr Roy, but he was bored with the other two boys there, who, also owing to illness,
                were being crammed or coached by Mr Roy. One was much older than Philip, and the other was a poor
                whining creature who was simply terrified of the various insects and animals that Philip always seemed
                to be collecting or rescuing. The boy was intensely fond of all creatures and had an amazing knack of
                making them trust him. id or
                Now he hurried down the hillside, eager to see if another pupil had joined the little holiday collection
                of boys to be coached. If the new boy owned the parrot, he would be somebody interesting - more
                interesting than that big lout of a Sam, and better fun than Oliver. poor whining

                He opened the garden gate and then stared in sur prise. A girl was in the garden, not a very big girl -
                perhaps about eleven. She had red hair, rather curly, and green eyes, a fair skin and hundreds of
                freckles. She stared at Philip.

                'Hallo,' said Philip, rather liking the look of the girl, who was dressed in shorts and a jersey. 'Have
                you come here?

                'Looks like it,' said the girl, with a grin. 'But I haven't come to work. Only to be with Jack.'

                'Who's Jack?' asked Philip. 'My brother," said the girl. 'He's got to be coached. You should have seen
                his report last term. He was bot tom in everything. He's very clever really, but he just doesn't bother.
                He says he's going to be an ornithologist, so what's the good of learning dates and capes and and
                things?" poems

                'What's an- an- whatever it was you said?' said Philip, wondering how anyone could possibly have so many
                freckles on her nose this girl had.

                Ornithologist? Oh, it's someone who loves and stud ies birds,' said the girl. 'Didn't you know that?
                Jack's mad on birds,'

                'He ought to come and live where I live then,' said Philip at once. 'I live on a very wild, lonely part
                of the sea-coast, and there are heaps of rare sea-birds there. I like birds too, but I don't know much
                about them. I say - does that parrot belong to Jack? 'Yes,' said the girl. 'He's had her for four years.
                Her name is Kiki.'
                'Did he teach it to say all those things?" said Philip, thinking that though Jack might be bottom in all
                school subjects he would certainly get top marks for teaching parrots to talk!
                'Oh no,' said the girl, smiling, so that her green eyes twinkled and crinkled. 'Kiki just picked up
                those sayings of hers-picked them up from our old uncle, who is the crossest old man in the world, I
                should think. Our mother and father are dead, so Uncle Geoffrey has us in the hols, and doesn't he just
                hate it! His housekeeper hates us too, so we don't have much of a time, but so long as I have Jack, and
                so long as Jack has his beloved birds, we are happy enough.'
                'I suppose Jack got sent here to learn a few things, like me,' said Philip. You'll be lucky - you'll be
                able to play, go for walks, do what you like, whilst we are stew ing in lessons.'
                'No, I shan't,' said the girl. 'I shall be with Jack. I don't have him in the school term, so I'm jolly
                well going to have him in the hols. I think he's marvellous."
                "Well, that's more than my sister, Dinah, thinks of me,' said Philip. 'We're always quarrelling. Hallo -
                is this Jack?'
                A boy came up the path towards Philip. On his left shoulder sat the parrot, Kiki, rubbing her beak
                softly against Jack's ear, and saying something in a low voice. The boy scratched the parrot's head and
                gazed at Philip with the same green eyes as his sister had. His hair was even redder, and his face so
                freckled that it would have been impossible to find a clear space anywhere, for there seemed to be
                freckles on top of freckles.
                'Hallo, Freckles,' said Philip, and grinned. 'Hallo, Tufty,' said Jack, and grinned too. Philip put up
                his hand and felt his front bit of hair, which always tose up in a sort of tuft. No amount of water and
                brush ing would make it lie down for long. 'Wipe your feet,' said Kiki severely. 'I'm glad you found
                Kiki all right,' said the girl. 'She didn't like coming to a strange place, and that's why she flew off,
                I expect.
                'She wasn't far away, Lucy-Ann,' said Jack. 'I bet old Tufty here got a fright if he heard her up on the
                hillside.
                'I did,' said Philip, and began telling the two what had happened. They laughed loudly, and Kiki joined
                in, cackling in a most human manner.
                'Golly, I'm glad you and Lucy-Ann have come here,' said Philip, feeling much happier than he had felt
                for some days. He liked the look of the red-haired, green eyed brother and sister very much. They would
                be friends. He would show them the animals he had as pets. They could go for walks together. Jack was
                some years older than Lucy-Ann, about fourteen, Philip thought, just a little older than he himself was.
                It was a pity Dinah wasn't there too, then there would be four of them. Dinah was twelve. She would fit
                in nicely - only, per haps, with her quick impatience and quarrelsome nature, it might not be peaceful!
                'How different Lucy-Ann and Jack are from me and Dinah,' thought Philip. It was quite plain that
                Lucy-Ann adored Jack, and Philip could not imagine Dinah hang ing on to his words, eager to do his
                bidding, fetching and carrying for him, as Lucy-Ann did for Jack.
                'Oh, well people are different,' thought the boy. 'Dinah's a good sort, even if we do quarrel and fight.
                She must be having a pretty awful time at Craggy-Tops with out me. I bet Aunt Polly is working her
                hard.'
                It was pleasant at tea-time that day to sit and watch Jack's parrot on his shoulder, making remarks from
                time to time. It was good to see the glint in Lucy-Ann's green eyes as she teased big, slow Sam, and
                ticked off the smaller, peevish Oliver. Things would liven up a bit now.
                They certainly did. Holiday coaching was much more fun with Jack and Lucy-Ann there too.</p>
