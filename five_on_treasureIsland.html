            <h1>Chapter 1<br>A Great Surprise</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">"Mum, have you decided about our summer holidays yet?" said Julian, at the
                breakfast-table. Can we go to Polseath as usual?'
                'I'm afraid not,' said his mother. "They're full up this year.'
                The three children at the breakfast-table looked at one another in great disappointment. They loved the
                house at Polseath, and the beach was perfect for swimming.
                'Cheer up,' said Dad. 'We'll find somewhere else just as good for you. But Mum and I won't be going with
                you this year. Did Mum tell you?'
                "No!" said Anne in surprise. "But... you always come
                with us on our holidays!'
                'Well, this time Dad and I have planned to go to Scotland," said Mum. "Just the two of us! You're all
                old enough to look after yourselves now, and we thought you'd love the chance to have a holiday on your
                own! But now that you can't go to Polseath, I don't really know where to send you."
                "What about Quentin's?" said Dad suddenly. Quentin was his brother, the children's uncle. They had only
                seen him once, and had found him a bit scary. a very tall, frowning man, a clever scientist who spent
                all his time studying. He lived by the sea - but that was pretty much all that the children knew about
                him! He was
                'Quentin?" said Mum. "What made you think of him? I shouldn't think he'd want the children messing about
                in his little house."
                "Well," said Dad, 'I bumped into Quentin's wife in town the other day, and I don't think things are
                going too well for them. Fanny said that she's thinking of getting a lodger for a while, to bring a bit
                of money in. Their house is by the sea, you know. It might be just the thing for the children. Fanny's
                very nice - she'd look after them."
                "Yes - and she has a child of her own, too,' said Mum. "What's her name - something unusual - yes,
                Georgina! How old would she be? About eleven, I should think.
                "Same age as me," said Dick. 'It's strange to think we've got a cousin who we've never met! She must get
                lonely all by herself. I've got Julian and Anne to play with-but Georgina is just one on her own. I bet
                she'd be glad to see us."
                'Well, your Aunt Fanny said that Georgina would love a bit of company,' said Dad. "You know, I really
                think that would solve the problem, if we ring Fanny and arrange for the children to go there. It would
                help Fanny, I'm sure, and Georgina would love to have someone to play with in the holidays. And we'd
                know that our three were safe."
                The children began to feel excited. It would be fun to go to a place they had never visited before, and
                stay with an unknown cousin.
                Are there cliffs and rocks and sandy beaches there?"
                asked Anne. "Is it a nice place?" 'I don't remember it very well," said Dad. "But I'm sure it's an
                exciting kind of place. Anyway, you'll love : It's called Kirrin Bay. Your Aunt Fanny has lived there
                all her life, and wouldn't leave it for anything."
                "Oh Dad, ring Aunt Fanny right now and ask her if we can go there!' cried Dick. 'Please! I just feel as
                if it's the right place somehow. It sounds sort of adventurous!"
                "You always say that, wherever you go!' said Dad,
                with a laugh. 'All right - I'll ring up now and see if
                there's any chance."
                They had all finished their breakfast, but they waited while Dad went out into the hall to telephone. 'I
                hope it's all right!' said Julian. 'I wonder what
                Georgina's like. Funny name, isn't it? More like a boy's than a girl's. So she's eleven - a year younger
                than I am - same age as you, Dick-and a year older than you, Anne. She ought to fit in with us all
                right. We'll have lots of fun!'
                Dad came back in about ten minutes' time, and the children knew at once that he had good news. He smiled
                at them.
                "Well, that's settled,' he said. 'Your Aunt Fanny's delighted about it. She says it will be good for
                Georgina to have company, because she's such a lonely little girl, always going off by herself. And
                she'll love looking after you all. Only you'll have to be careful not to disturb your Uncle Quentin.
                He's working very hard, and he isn't very good-tempered when he's disturbed." We'll be as quiet as mice
                in the house!' said Dick.
                *When are we going, Dad?'
                "Next week, if that's all right with Mum,' said Dad.
                Mum nodded. "Yes,' she said, 'there's nothing much to get ready for them - just swimming costumes and
                jumpers and jeans. They all wear the same.'
                'It'll be lovely to wear jeans again,' said Anne, dancing around. I'm sick of wearing my school uniform.
                I want to wear jeans, or a swimming costume, and go swimming and climbing.'
                'Well, you'll soon be doing it,' said Mum, with a laugh. 'Remember to put ready any toys or books you
                want, won't you? Not many, please, because there won't be a lot of room."
                'Anne wanted to take all her fifteen teddies with her
                last year,' said Dick. 'Do you remember, Anne? That was
                funny!
                'No it wasn't,' said Anne, going red. 'I love my bears, and I just couldn't choose which to take so I
                thought I'd take them all. There's nothing funny about that."
                'And do you remember the year before, Anne wanted to take the rocking-horse?' said
                Dick, with a giggle. Mum chimed in. "You know, I remember a little boy called Dick who put aside one
                teddy bear, three toy dogs, two toy cats and his old monkey to take down to Polseath one year,' she
                said. It was Dick's turn to go red. He changed the subject
                at once. 'Dad, are we going by train or by car?" he asked. 'By car,' said Dad. 'We can boot. Well-what
                about Tuesday?" pile everything into the
                "That would suit me,' said Mum. 'We could take the children down, come back, and have plenty of time to
                do our own packing, and set off for Scotland on the Friday. Yes - we'll arrange for Tuesday.'
                So Tuesday it was. The children counted the days eagerly, and Anne marked one off the calendar each
                night. The week seemed to pass very slowly. But at last Tuesday did come. Dick and Julian, who shared a
                room, woke up at about the same moment, and stared out of the nearby window.
                'It's a lovely day!' cried Julian, leaping out of bed. 'I don't know why, but it always seems very
                important that it should be sunny on the first day of a holiday. Let's wake Anne.'
                Anne slept in the next room. Julian ran in and shook her. 'Wake up! It's Tuesday! And the sun's
                shining.'
                Anne woke up with a start and smiled at Julian happily. 'It's come at last!' she said. 'I thought it
                never would. Isn't it an exciting feeling to go away on holiday!'
                They set off soon after breakfast. Their car was big, so it held them all very comfortably. Mum sat in
                fron with Dad, and the three children sat behind, their feet on two suitcases. In the boot were all
                kinds of odds and ends, and one small trunk. Mum was sure they had remembered everything.
                Along the crowded London roads they went, slowly at first, and then, as they left the town behind, more
                quickly. Soon they were right into the open country, and the car sped along fast. The children sang
                song. they always did when they were happy.
                'Are we picnicking soon? asked Anne, feeling hungry all of a sudden.
                'Not yet,' said Mum. "It's only eleven o'clock. We
                won't have lunch till at least half-past twelve, Anne 'Oh, Mum!' said Anne. 'I can't hold out till then!
                Mum handed her some chocolate, and she and the
                boys munched happily, watching the hills, woods and
                fields as the car sped by.
                The picnic was lovely. They had it on the top of a hill, in a sloping field that looked down into a
                sunny valley Anne didn't really like a big brown cow which came up close and stared at her, but it went
                away when Dad told it to. The children ate ravenously, and Mum said that instead of having a picnic tea
                at half-past four they would have to go to a cafe somewhere, because they had eaten all the tea
                sandwiches as well as the lunch ones!
                'What time will we reach Aunt Fanny's? asked Julian, finishing the very last sandwich and wishing there
                were more.
                'About six o'clock with luck,' said Dad. "Now who wants to stretch their legs a bit? We've another long
                drive in the car, you know.'
                The car seemed to eat up the miles as it purred along Tea-time came, and then the three children began
                to feel excited all over again.
                "We should watch out for the sea,' said Dick. 'I can smell it somewhere near!"
                He was right. The car suddenly topped a hill - and there was the shining blue sea, calm and smooth in
                the evening sun. The three children gave a yell.
                'There it is!'
                'Isn't it gorgeous!"
                'Oh, I want to swim this very minute!'
                "Only twenty minutes now, before we're at Kirrin Bay,' said Dad. 'We've made good time. You'll see the
                bay soon - it's quite a big one with a funny sort of island at the entrance of the bay."
                The children looked out for it as they drove along the coast. Then Julian gave a shout.
                "There it is that must be Kirrin Bay. Look, Dick - isn't it lovely and blue?"
                'And look at the rocky little island guarding the
                entrance of the bay,' said Dick. 'I'd like to visit that.' 'Well, I'm sure you will,' said Mum. 'Now,
                let's look out for Aunt Fanny's house. It's called Kirrin Cottage.' They soon found it. It stood on the
                low cliff
                overlooking the bay, and was a very old house indeed. It wasn't really a cottage, but quite a big house,
                built of old white stone. Roses climbed over the front of it, and the garden was full of flowers.
                'Here's Kirrin Cottage,' said Dad, and he stopped the car in front of it. "It's supposed to be about
                three hundred years old! Now - where's Quentin? Ah, there's Fanny!'
